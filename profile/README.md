# Cooking with Granite

Welcome to Cooking with Granite: a community hub for building with IBM's [Granite Model Family](https://www.ibm.com/granite) and a project of [The AI Alliance](https://thealliance.ai/).

Come check out our cookbooks and our kitchen, and you'll be cooking with Granite in no time!

## Granite Cookbooks

The following _Granite Cookbooks_ provide open source recipes for using the Granite models:

* [Granite Snack Cookbook](https://github.com/ibm-granite-community/granite-snack-cookbook) has introductory "Hello, World!" recipes that run quickly on small datasets.
* [Granite Code Cookbook](https://github.com/ibm-granite-community/granite-code-cookbook)
* [Granite Finance Cookbook](https://github.com/ibm-granite-community/granite-finance-cookbook)
* [Granite Legal Cookbook](https://github.com/ibm-granite-community/granite-legal-cookbook)
* [Granite Time Series Cookbook](https://github.com/ibm-granite-community/granite-timeseries-cookbook)

The _Granite Kitchen_ provides information on using Granite on several hosting platforms, finding compatible vector databases, and some utilities for notebook environments.

## About

The Granite family of foundation models span an increasing variety of modalities, including language, code, time series, and science (e.g., materials) - with much more to come. We're building them with transparency and with focus on fulfilling rigorous enterprise requirements that are emerging for AI. If you'd like to learn more about the models themselves and how we build them, check out [Granite Models](https://github.com/ibm-granite).

**The mission of Cooking with Granite is to work collaboratively across industries and geographies to leverage Granite to solve problems and bring value across use cases, from code generation and modernization, to forecasting and predictive maintenance, to materials discovery.**

Our first goal is to build out a community kitchen for Granite, starting with cookbooks that have proven recipes to help enrich, adapt, and apply Granite models to real world applications.
