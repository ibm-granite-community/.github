# Contributing

👍🎉 First off, thank you for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍

This document describes our guidelines for contributing. They are guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## What Should I Know Before I Get Started?

We welcome contributions to all our projects, but contributors must accept certain agreements and conditions.

### The Code of Conduct

This project adheres to our [Code of Conduct][CoC]. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. If you observe unacceptable behavior, follow the instructions in the document to report it.

### Developer Certificate of Origin

This organization utilizes the Linux Foundation’s [Developer Certificate of Origin][DCO] (DCO) on a per-commit basis to enable contributions to Core Projects. The DCO does not require the committer to give away ownership of the contribution - your IP remains yours and others' IP remains theirs.

Using DCO signoff is discussed in more detail [below](#legal).

### Signed Commits

This organization utilizes GitHub's recommended practices for integration branch management (e.g., `main`), including the requirement to GPG or SSH sign commits.

Setting up signing of commits is discussed in more detail [below](#signing-commits).

## The GitHub Organization and Repositories

This repository contains common files, like this one, that apply to all projects in our GitHub organization.

## The Contribution Process

We follow normal _GitOps_ practices. We ask that all work in a particular repo be contributed as a pull request where it will be, built automatically and tested (for code changes), reviewed by maintainers, and merged when accepted.

### Creating a Contribution

As an example, let's use the [`granite-snack-cookbook`][granite-snack-cookbook] repo.

Before you start working on a contribution to this guide review the [open issues][granite-snack-cookbook-issues] and [open pull requests][granite-snack-cookbook-pulls] to see if your contribution or enhancements are already proposed. You might instead be able to join forces with the people already working on these items. If you are unsure about how to contribute an idea, [open an issue][granite-snack-cookbook-issues] first to discuss your proposal idea with the maintainers.

> **Note:** Review the [Legal](#legal) section below before making any commits to a repo or a fork of one.

To contribute to this repo, you'll use the _Fork and Pull_ model common in many open source repositories. You can follow this process in a local terminal or in the GitHub web UI.

- For details on the local process, check out the [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow) documentation from GitHub. The web UI process is similar.

When your contribution is ready, you can create a pull request (PR). In general, we follow the standard [GitHub pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests) process. Follow the template to provide details about your pull request to the maintainers. Before submitting pull requests, run any tests or formatting constraints locally that are defined for the repository, if any. For example, does the repo have a `make test` command for running the unit tests?

### Submitting Your Contribution

When submitting your PR, give it a title and description which are as clear and detailed as possible.

### Pull Request Review

After submitting a pull request, maintainers will review it and may make suggestions to fix before merging. It will be easier for your pull request to receive reviews if you consider the criteria the reviewers follow while working. Remember to:

- Run tests (if any) locally and ensure that they pass.
- Ensure your contribution is in the proper format, if defined, e.g., documentation conventions.
- Break large changes into a logical series of smaller patches, which are easy to understand individually and combine to solve a broader issue.
- Follow the project's coding and documentation conventions.

For a list of the maintainers, see the [MAINTAINERS.md][maintainers] page.

## Submitting Bug Reports

To submit a new bug report, raise an issue in the appropriate repository before creating a pull request. This ensures that the issue is properly tracked. To fix an existing bug, assign yourself a bug from the issues page of the desired repository. Then, submit a pull request for review.

Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues in the corresponding repo.

## Legal

We have tried to make it as easy as possible to make contributions.
This applies to how we handle the legal aspects of contribution.

### "Developer Certificate of Origin"

We follow the [Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1 (DCO)][DCO] to manage code contributions, which is the same approach that [the Linux Kernel community uses][Linux-DCO].

We ask that all developers include a sign-off statement in the commit message. Here is an example `Signed-off-by` line, which indicates that the submitter accepts the DCO:

```text
Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>
```

This can be included automatically in a commit to a local Git repository using the following command:

```shell
git commit --signoff ... # or use -s
```

> **Tips:**
>
> 1. If a commit was created that did not include the `-s` or `--signoff` flag, the original commit message can be edited by using the `git commit -s --amend` command. A "force push" must be done afterward to add the amended commit to a PR.
> 2. Consider creating a git _alias_ that permanently adds the `--signoff` flag to all commits. For example, let's define a `cs` alias for this purpose:
>
> ```shell
> git config --global alias.cs "commit --signoff"
> ...
> git cs -m 'Some comment' changed_files
> ```
>
> The alias will be added to your `~/.gitconfig` file.

If you don't want to make this a global alias, omit `--global` and run the command in each repo's root directory where you want to use it. The alias will be added to the `.git/config` file for your local repo clone.

If you forgot to sign off commits, you'll find out the hard way when you create a PR, because the _DCO_ GitHub app we use will reject the PR.

## Signing Commits

Following GitHub's recommendations for integration branch management (e.g., `main`), we require commits to be signed. _This is different than DCO sign**off**_, discussed above. Here, we mean using [Gnu GPG](https://gnupg.org) or SSH to digitally sign each commit.

To sign a commit, you add either the `--gpg-sign` or `-S` (capital `S`) flag to the commit. You can define an alias to include this flag, like we discussed above for DCO sign**off**, but we'll discuss using a configuration setting that turns on signing for all commits automatically. Similarly for signoff, if you forget to sign a commit, try using `git commit -S -s --amend ...` to fix it.

There are a few steps you will need to do locally and in your GitHub user account to set up signing. We'll assume you want to use SSH, so you don't have to install GPG. For full instructions, including how to use GPG, see [this GitHub page](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits).

First, create a key, if you don't have one. For example:

```shell
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

Now create a _signing key_ in your [GitHub account](https://github.com/settings/keys), if you don't already have one. In your account's [settings page for keys](https://github.com/settings/keys), click the green "New SSH key" button. Make sure you select "Signing key" in the menu for the key type. Name the key and paste the contents of your newly-created (or previously-existing) **public** key file, `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`.

Now tell your local git environment about the key. See the [full instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/telling-git-about-your-signing-key).

```shell
git config --global gpg.format ssh
git config --global user.signingkey ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub # or another /PATH/TO/.SSH/KEY.PUB file
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
```

> **NOTES:**
>
> 1. Setting `commit.gpgsign` to be `true` means that you don't have to provide the `--gpg-sign` or `-S` flag to `git commit`. Signing will be done automatically.
> 2. As discussed above for signoff, if you don't want to make these changes globally, omit the `--global` flag in these commands and run them in each repo where they should apply.
