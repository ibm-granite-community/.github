# Filing a Code of Conduct Violation Report

We take reports of violations to our project [Code of Conduct][CoC] with the utmost seriousness and will act upon them as quickly as possible.

To report a Code of Conduct violation to our Code of Conduct Committee, reach out to any member via the contact information in their GitHub profiles. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated in accordance with our Code of Conduct. Responses to complaints will be appropriate in the circumstances upon conclusion of a reasonable investigation.

As part of our follow up on your report, we would like to contact you for further discussion. If you would prefer not to engage beyond reporting the matter to the committee, please let us know that as part of your submission. We will respect your request.
